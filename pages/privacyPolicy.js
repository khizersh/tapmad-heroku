                  Facebook and Tapmad have developed a process that allows you
                  to connect your Tapmad account with your Facebook account.
                  When you connect your accounts, you authorize Tapmad and
                  Facebook to share certain information about you with each
                  other. When you connect your accounts, Tapmad will
                  automatically access the list of all your Facebook friends and
                  import them to Tapmad. In addition, if you visit Tapmad while
                  logged into Facebook, then Facebook may be able to identify
                  you and to associate the technical information provided by
                  your web browser with other information that Facebook already
                  has about you.
