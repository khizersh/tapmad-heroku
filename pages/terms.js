        unless it is expressly permitted by tapmad TV in writing. This
        prohibition applies even if you intend to give away the derivative
        materials free of charge.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Video Player. You may not modify, enhance, remove, interfere with,

        advertising, copyright notices, and trademarks) of the webpage where the

        functionality of the Video Player, including, without limitation, all

        <br />
        <br />
        Embedding a Video Using the Video Player. Where tapmad TV has
        incorporated an embed option in connection with Content on the tapmad TV
        Services, you may embed videos using the Video Player, provided you do
        not embed the Video Player on any website or other location that (i)
        contains or hosts content that is unlawful, infringing, pornographic,
        obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, harassing, vulgar, indecent,
        profane, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, encourages criminal
        conduct, gives rise to civil liability, violates any law, rule, or
        regulation, infringes any right of any third party including
        intellectual property rights, or is otherwise inappropriate or
        objectionable to tapmad TV (in tapmad TV 's sole discretion), or (ii)
        links to infringing or unauthorized content (collectively, "Unsuitable
        Material"). You may not embed the Video Player into any hardware or
        software application, even for non-commercial purposes. tapmad TV
        reserves the right to prevent embedding to any website or other location
        that tapmad TV finds inappropriate or objectionable (as determined by
        tapmad TV in its sole discretion).
        <br />
        <br />
        Ownership. You agree that tapmad TV owns and retains all rights to the
        tapmad TV Services. You further agree that the Content you access and
        view as part of the tapmad TV Services is owned or controlled by tapmad
        TV and tapmad TV 's licensors. The tapmad TV Services and the Content
        are protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property
        laws.
        <br />
        <br />

        any content protection or access control mechanisms intended to prevent
        the unauthorized download, stream capture, linking, framing,
        reproduction, access to, or distribution of the tapmad TV Services);
        <br />
        involves accessing the tapmad TV Services (including the Content)through
        any automated means, including "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers"
        (other than by individually performed searches on publicly accessible
        search engines for the sole purpose of, and solely to the extent
        necessary for, creating publicly available search indices - but not
        caches or archives - of the tapmad TV Services and excluding those
        search engines or indices that host, promote, or link primarily to
        infringing or unauthorized content);
        <br />

        interrupt, destroy, or limit the functionality of any computer software
        or hardware or telecommunications equipment;
        <br />

        the tapmad TV Services, including tapmad TV 's servers, computer
        network, or user accounts;
        <br />

        to civil liability;
        <br />
        violates these Terms or any guidelines or policies posted by tapmad TV;
        <br />
        interferes with any other party's use and enjoyment of the tapmad TV
        Services; or
        <br />
        attempts to do any of the foregoing.
        <br />
        If tapmad TV determines in its sole discretion that you are violating
        any of these Terms, we may (i) notify you, and (ii) use technical
        measures to block or restrict your access or use of the tapmad TV
        Services. In either case, you agree to immediately stop accessing or
        using in any way (or attempting to access or use) the tapmad TV
        Services, and you agree not to circumvent, avoid, or bypass such
        restrictions, or otherwise restore or attempt to restore such access or
        use.
        <br />
        <br />
        No Spam/Unsolicited Communications. We know how annoying and upsetting
        it can be to receive unwanted email or instant messages from people you
        do not know. Therefore, no one may use the tapmad TV Services to harvest
        information about users for the purpose of sending, or to facilitate or
        encourage the sending of, unsolicited bulk or other communications. You
        understand that we may take any technical remedies to prevent spam or
        unsolicited bulk or other communications from entering, utilizing, or
        remaining within our computer or communications networks. If you Post
        (as defined below in Section 7) or otherwise send spam, advertising, or
        other unsolicited communications of any kind through the tapmad TV
        Services, you acknowledge that you will have caused substantial harm to
        Tapmad TV and that the amount of such harm would be extremely difficult
        to measure. As a reasonable estimation of such harm, you agree to pay
        tapmad TV $50 for each such unsolicited communication you send through
        the tapmad TV Services.
        <br />
        <br />
        Downloads. In order to participate in certain tapmad TV Services or
        access certain Content, you may be notified that it is necessary to
        download software or other materials or agree to additional terms and
        conditions. Unless otherwise provided by these additional terms and
        conditions, they are hereby incorporated into these Terms.
        <br />
        <br />
        Suspension/Discontinuation. We hope not to, but we may change, suspend,
        or discontinue - temporarily or permanently - some or all of the tapmad
        TV Services (including the Content and the devices through which the
        tapmad TV Services are accessed), with respect to any or all users, at
        any time without notice. You acknowledge that tapmad TV may do so in
        tapmad TV 's sole discretion. You also agree that tapmad TV will not be
        liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the
        tapmad TV Services, although if you are a tapmad TV subscriber and
        tapmad TV suspends or discontinues the tapmad TV service, tapmad TV may,
        in its sole discretion, provide you with a credit, refund, discount or
        other form of consideration (for example, we may credit additional days
        of service to your account) in accordance with Section 4 below. However,
        if tapmad TV terminates your account or suspends or discontinues your
        access to tapmad TV Services due to your violation of these Terms, then
        you will not be eligible for any such credit, refund, discount or other
        consideration.
        <br />
        Internet Access Charges. You are responsible for any costs you incur to
        access the internet.
        <br />
        <br />
        Customer Service. If we can be of help to you, please do not hesitate to
        contact our customer service department by visiting our customer service

        <strong>4. tapmad TV Subscriptions and Billing</strong>
        <br />
        While it is our mission to provide users with as many viewing choices as
        possible, sometimes that involves giving users the choice of paying a
        fee in order to view Content that tapmad TV would not otherwise be able
        to make available without charging a fee. For that reason, we ask you to
        pay a subscription fee to access the tapmad TV Content.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can find the specific details regarding your subscription to tapmad
        TV at any time by logging in on the tapmad TV website and clicking on
        Account under your name. You agree that your tapmad TV account is for
        individual use only and your tapmad TV account is limited to only one
        simultaneous stream at a time. Additionally, you agree that for various
        reasons, such as restrictions from content licensors and other
        limitations or considerations from third parties, certain Content that
        may be accessible through one Property may not be accessible through
        other Properties.
        <br />
        <br />
        Because the tapmad TV Service is offered in multiple time zones, for
        consistency, a "day" for purposes of these Terms of Use begins at 12:00
        a.m. PST and ends at 11:59 p.m. PST of that same calendar day.
      </p>
      <p style={{ color: "#fff" }}>
        <br />
        <strong>Billing.</strong>
        <br />
        By providing a credit card, SMS or other payment method accepted by
        tapmad TV ("Payment Method") for your tapmad TV subscription, you are
        expressly agreeing that we are authorized to charge you a monthly
        subscription fee, any other fees for additional services you may
        purchase, and any applicable taxes in connection with your use of tapmad
        TV to the Payment Method. If you want to use a different Payment Method
        than the one you signed up for during registration, or if there is a
        change in your credit card validity or expiration date, you may edit
        your Payment Method information by logging in on the tapmad TV website
        and clicking on Account under your name. If your Payment Method expires
        and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your
        account, you authorize us to continue billing, and you will remain
        responsible for any uncollected amounts.
        <br />
        <br />
        As used in these Terms of Use, "billing" shall indicate either a charge
        or debit, as applicable, against your Payment Method. The subscription
        fee will be billed at the beginning of your subscription or expiration
        of your free trial period, if any, whichever is earlier, and on each
        monthly renewal thereafter unless and until you cancel your subscription
        or the account or service is otherwise suspended or discontinued
        pursuant to these Terms. To see the commencement date for your next
        renewal period, log in on the tapmad TV website and click on Account
        under your name.
        <br />
        <br />
        We automatically bill your Payment Method each month on the calendar day
        corresponding to the commencement of your subscription (each such month,
        a "Monthly Period"). In the event your subscription began on a day not
        contained in a given month, we bill your Payment Method on the last day
        of such month. For example, if you became a paying subscriber on January
        31, your Payment Method would next be billed on February 28. If you
        change your Payment Method, this could result in changing the calendar
        day upon which you are billed. You acknowledge that the amount billed
        each Monthly Period may vary due to promotional offers, changes in your
        subscription plan, and changes in applicable taxes, and you authorize us
        to charge your Payment Method for the corresponding amounts. If tapmad
        TV changes the subscription fee or other charges for tapmad TV from time
        to time, we will give you advance notice of these changes by email.
        However, we will not be able to notify you of changes in any applicable
        taxes.
        <br />
        <br />
        Very rarely, if there are special circumstances where tapmad TV
        determines it is appropriate (e.g., the tapmad TV service is unavailable
        for days due to technical difficulties), we may provide credits to
        affected subscribers. The amount and form of such credits, and the
        decision to provide them, are at tapmad TV 's sole and absolute
        discretion, and the provision of credits in one instance does not
        entitle anyone to credits in the future under similar or different
        circumstances.

      <p style={{ color: "#fff" }}>
        <br />
        <strong>Ongoing Subscription and Cancellation.</strong>
        <br />
        Your tapmad TV subscription will continue in effect on a month-to-month
        basis unless and until you cancel your subscription or the account or
        service is otherwise suspended or discontinued pursuant to these Terms.
        You must cancel your subscription before it renews each Monthly Period
        in order to avoid the next billing. We will bill the monthly
        subscription fee any applicable taxes to the Payment Method you provide
        to us during registration (or to a different Payment Method if you
        change your account information). If you cancel your subscription,
        cancellation will be effective at the end of the current Monthly Period
        -this means that you will have continued access to tapmad TV for the
        remainder of that period, but you will not receive a refund. You can
        cancel your account by logging in on the tapmad TV website and clicking
        on Account under your name and then choosing to "edit" your subscription
        under "Billing Information" and clicking on the "cancel" option.

        <br />
        <strong>Unpaid Amounts.</strong>
        <br />
        In order to sustain the tapmad TV service, it is important that each
        user of the tapmad TV service honor the payment obligations to which the
        user agreed. Accordingly, we reserve the right to pursue any amounts you
        fail to pay in connection with tapmad TV . You will remain liable to
        tapmad TV for all such amounts and all costs we incur in connection with
        the collection of these amounts, including, without limitation,
        collection agency fees, reasonable attorneys' fees, and arbitration or
        court costs.

        On occasion, we may be authorized to offer the use of tapmad TV through
        free trials for certain qualifying users. If we offer you a free trial,
        the specific terms of your free trial will be stated in the marketing
        material describing the particular free trial. We are unable to
        accommodate combining free trials with any other offers. To view the
        specific details regarding your free trial, if any, log in on the tapmad
        TV website and click on Account under your name.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once your free trial period ends, we will begin billing your Payment
        Method for monthly subscription fees corresponding to your subscription
        plan ( any applicable taxes), unless you cancel prior to the end of your
        free trial. For that reason, unless otherwise indicated in the free
        trial description, you may be asked to set up a valid Payment Method
        when redeeming a free trial offer.
        <br />
        <br />
        It is very important to understand that you will not receive a notice
        from tapmad TV that your free trial subscription has ended or that your
        paying subscription has begun. If you wish to avoid charges to your
        Payment Method, you must cancel tapmad TV prior to midnight Eastern Time
        on the last day of your free trial period. You can cancel your account
        by logging in on the tapmad TV website and clicking on Account under
        your name then choosing to "edit" your subscription under "Billing
        Information" and clicking on the "cancel" option. We will continue to
        bill your Payment Method on a monthly basis for your subscription plan
        until you cancel or the account or service is otherwise suspended or
        discontinued pursuant to these Terms. You may cancel your subscription
        at any time as described in the Ongoing Subscription and Cancellation
        section of these Terms. To the extent tapmad TV subscriptions are
        offered in conjunction with purchases of, or payment for, third party
        products or services, you agree that tapmad TV will not be liable to you
        for any claims arising out of or related to your purchase or use of such
